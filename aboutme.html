<h2>Reflections on Coding, 7/19/17</h2>
  <p><font size="5"> Today, I coded my first program in Python! Unlike Scratch, which has premade blocks of code, Python requires the coder to type correct syntax out themselves. This was a bit of a challenge for me, since I don't really have a lot of knowledge on the syntax of Python.
  However, with some help, I was able to create a program which will create shapes based on user input!<p>
    <h2>Reflections on Coding, 7/21/17</h2>
    <p><font size="5"> Yesterday was an exciting day because I learned how to code my own filters-- and today, I finally got them to work! Someday, though, I hope to make Snapchat level filters-- advanced filters, like the dog filter, for example. It was challenging to get the exact correct syntax, but it felt really good once I got it.</font></p>
