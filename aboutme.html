<h2>Reflections on Coding, 7/19/17</h2>
  <p><font size="5"> Today, I coded my first program in Python! Unlike Scratch, which has premade blocks of code, Python requires the coder to type correct syntax out themselves. This was a bit of a challenge for me, since I don't really have a lot of knowledge on the syntax of Python. 
  However, with some help, I was able to create a program which will create shapes based on user input!<p>
