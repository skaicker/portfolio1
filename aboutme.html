<h1>About me!</h1>
  <p><font size="5"> Hey! I'm a fifteen-year-old student who lives in Manhattan, New York. Since joining Girls Who Code, I've discovered a passion for coding. I also have a hobby for photography, which you can <a=href http://skaicker.vsco.co check out here.> I hope you enjoy browsing through my page!</font> </p>
<h2> Reflections on Coding, 7/19/17 </h2>
  <p><font size="5"> Today, I coded my first program in Python! Unlike Scratch, which has premade blocks of code, Python requires the coder to type correct syntax out themselves. This was a bit of a challenge for me, since I don't really have a lot of knowledge on the syntax of Python. 
  However, with some help, I was able to create a program which will create shapes based on user input!
